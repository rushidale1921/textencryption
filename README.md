# RSA Encryption and Decryption

This project implements RSA encryption and decryption in Python. It allows users to encrypt a message using a generated public key and then decrypt it using the corresponding private key.

## Features

- Automatically generates RSA key pairs (public and private).
- Encrypts user-input text using the public key.
- Decrypts the encrypted text using the private key.
- Outputs both the encrypted and decrypted text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
